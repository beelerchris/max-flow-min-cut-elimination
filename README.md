# Max-flow Min-cut Baseball end-of-season elimination
A Julia implementation of the graph theory based max-flow min-cut baseball end-of-season elimination problem. This problem deals with determining when a baseball team is mathematically eliminated from a division, i.e. when it becomes impossible for them to finish in 1st place.

The file **graph_functions.jl** never needs to be run. This file only contains functions which are imported by the other included files. To use this method on a specific division standing, the name of the text file which contains the division standing information must be specified on line 4 of **elimination.jl**. The two examples from this report are included in the files **division_1.txt** and **division_2.txt** respectively. Once the division is specified, **elimination.jl** can be run and will output the certificate of elimination for each eliminated team. If there is no output from running this code then no teams are eliminated.

To run the Quidditch experiment from this report, the number of teams must be specified on line 19 of **quidditch.jl** with the requirement 2 &leq; *n* &leq; 13 and *n* is an integer. Once **quidditch.jl** has been run, all $n(n-1)$ division standing text files will be stored in **quidditch_div/** under the name **division_quid_$i$.txt** for 1 &leq; *i* &leq; *n*(*n*-1). Next **elimination_quidditch.jl** can be run and will output the number of matches before they were eliminated and the certificate of elimination for each team which does not finish in first place. Note that this code will always output something unless all $n$ teams finish the division tied for first place. Alternatively, line 10 of **elimination_quidditch.jl** can be commented out, and line 11, 12, or 13 can be uncommented to use one of the three example divisions shown in this report.
